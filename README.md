- Error handling;
- Loading states;

**Target level**: This is an all around challenge that covers both juniors and experienced devs based on the depth of how the concepts were applied.

**Final accomplishment**: By the end of this challenge you'll have a working development app.

- MVVM structures
- Implement pagination with both lists of the app.
- Implement error handling and reload options
- Manage the loading states accordingly

## Instructions to run

Fork the repo, in the forked repo, create a new branch to work on. Create a new project and do your work on that branch of the forked repo. When done, open a pull request from your branch to the master branch of the forked repo so that the end result can be reviewed.

## Evaluation

Our evaluation will be conducted over the state of the forked repository in which the challenge is done.
